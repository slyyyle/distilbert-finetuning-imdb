# distilbert-finetuning-imdb

## Contents:  

*imdb_sentiment.ipynb* - Jupyter notebook used to finetune distilbert-base to detect binary sentiment (good/bad) from IMDB reviews.  This problem was quite simple and thus, the results were quite good after finetuning.  This was a relatively "on-the-rails" example which allowed me to re-acquaint with the huggingface package ecosystem.
